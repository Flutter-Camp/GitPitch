# FlutterCamp GitPitch 

[GitPitch](https://gitpitch.com/) is a hosted-presentation service that allows you to create slides using Markdown. It is inspired by [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/) and will likely be familiar to those who've used that format.

I'll use this repo to create a number of Flutter-oriented short decks using GitPitch (where each topic will be covered in its own branch). The _template_ branch will serve as the baseline "template" for these presentations.

## About GitPitch

To create a presentation, create a [PITCHME.md](https://gitpitch.com/features) file in your GitHub repo; it will automatically get hosted at _https://gitpitch.com/<github-username>/<github-reponame>_ for you. And, if you create branches within that repo, each with it's own custom **PITCHME.md** file, those branches can be individually accessed at _https://gitpitch.com/<github-username>/<github-reponame>/<branch-name>_
